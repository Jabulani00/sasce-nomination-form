## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser
- Firebase project with Firestore and Storage enabled

### Installation
1. Clone or download the project files
2. Ensure you have the following files:
   - `index.html` - Main form page
   - `styles.css` - Styling and responsive design
   - `script.js` - Form logic and Firebase integration

### Firebase Configuration
The Firebase configuration is already included in the HTML file. Make sure your Firebase project has:
- Firestore Database enabled
- Proper security rules configured

### Security Rules
For Firestore, ensure you have appropriate security rules:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /nominations/{document} {
      allow create: if true; // Allow anyone to create nominations
      allow read, update, delete: if false; // Restrict other operations
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: Since files are stored as base64 strings in Firestore, no separate Storage security rules are needed.

## Usage

### Data Storage
